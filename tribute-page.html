        <div id="img-caption">Lysander Spooner (1808–1887) is the American individualist anarchist and legal theorist
            known mainly for setting up a commercial post office in competition with the government and thereby being
            shut down. But he was also the author of some of the most radical political and economic writings of
            the 19th century, and continues to have a huge influence on libertarian thinkers today. He was a dedicated
            opponent of slavery in all its forms — even advocating guerrilla war to stop it — but also a dedicated
            opponent of the federal invasion of the South and its postwar reconstruction.The information in the caption

            <p>Lysander Spooner <strong>(January 19, 1808 – May 14, 1887)</strong> was an American political
                philosopher, essayist, pamphlet writer, Unitarian, abolitionist, legal theorist, and entrepreneur of
                the nineteenth century. He was a strong advocate of the labor movement and severely anti-authoritarian
                and individualist in his political views. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner"

            <p>Spooner's most famous writing includes the seminal abolitionist book The Unconstitutionality of Slavery,
                and No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority which opposed treason charges against secessionists.
                He is also known for competing with the U.S. Post Office with his American Letter Mail Company, which
                closed after legal problems with the federal government. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner"

            <p>Spooner advocated what he called Natural Law – or the "Science of Justice" – wherein acts of initiatory
                coercion against individuals and their property, such as taxation, were considered criminal because
                they were immoral while the so-called criminal acts that violated only man-made (arbitrary) legislation
                were not necessarily criminal. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <p>Spooner believed that it was beneficial for people to be self-employed so that they could enjoy the full
                benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms
                of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own
                businesses. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
